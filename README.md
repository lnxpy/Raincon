# RainCon
Let's see how you can customize your desktop of Debian-based distro. How would it be if you put something RainBow-like on your desktop? 

## Usage
### Conky Installation
If you are using a Debian-based Linux distribution such as any of the Ubuntu family, you can install `conky` on your system using `apt` package manager as follows.

`$ sudo apt-get install conky`

__You are able to install the `conky` on your favorite distros and different package managers.__

### RainCon Installation
**After the `conky` installation you need to install the `conkey-manager`. In this case, you have to Google it and find out the way you can install it on your distro.**

Now, It's time to explode your desktop. Clone this repo right in `~/.conky`. Now you have such a thing `~/.conky/raincon`. **Be awearnes you are using a hidden directory which means you may not be able to find this path at the first time**. Restart your system and reopen the `conky-manager`, then you will be able to have RainCon right at least of your list. Turn in on and enjoy.
