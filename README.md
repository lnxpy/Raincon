Hi Guy's!
Welcome to 🌈 Raincon 🌈!
Coloric Conky for Linux OS!

USAGE :
Installing Conky
If you are using a Debian based Linux distribution such as any of the Ubuntu family (Ubuntu, Ubuntu MATE, Ubuntu GNOME, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu etc), Linux Mint, Bodhi etc then use the following apt-get command:

$sudo apt-get install conky

If you are using Fedora or CentOS use the following yum command:

$sudo yum install conky

For openSUSE you would use the following zypper command

$sudo zypper install conky

For Arch Linux user the following PacMan command

$sudo pacman -S conky

In each of the cases above, I have included sudo to elevate your privileges.

Running Conky
You can run conky straight from the terminal by running the following command:

$conky

On its own, it isn't very good and you might find the screen flickers.
To get rid of the flicker run conky in the following way:s

$conky -b

To get conky to run as a background process use the following command:

$conky -b &
---

Install Conky Manager for Managing your conkies.
Download or clone it then cut all document's to a folder as 'Raincon'
Then cut or copy the Raincon folder to ~/.conky <-- this directory maybe hidden!
run the Conky Manager Software.
check the ~/.conky/Raincon/Raincon conky then use it.
